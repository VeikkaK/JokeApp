This is my React-based web application that allows users to retrieve and display jokes from an API. It uses an API key for authentication.

To run the Joke Application locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/VeikkaK/webfinal.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd webfinal

3. Install the dependencies:
   npm install

4. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your API key:
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key

5. Start the application:
   npm start


The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
